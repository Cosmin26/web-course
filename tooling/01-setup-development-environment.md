# Git

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

You can download GitHub's Git client from here: https://desktop.github.com.

Also, to dive deeper in how Git works I read these two articles:

- [Getting Started With Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
- [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook)
